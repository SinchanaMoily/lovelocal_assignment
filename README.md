Certainly! Here are three main points about the logic and reason behind the provided C code:

   - The primary purpose of the code is to determine the length of the last word in a given input string.
   - The function `lengthOfLastWord` takes a character array (`char *s`) as input and iterates through the string from the end.
   - The `main` function is responsible for taking input from the user using `fgets` to read a line of text (up to 99 characters) into the `input` array.
   - After obtaining the input, the `main` function calls the `lengthOfLastWord` function with the user-provided string.
   - The result (length of the last word) is stored in the variable `result`.

   - The primary purpose of the code is to find the shortest palindrome by adding characters in front of the given string `s`.
   - The function `shortestPalindrome` takes a string `s` as input and checks if it's empty or has only one character. 
   - The `main` function is responsible for taking a string input from the user using `scanf`.
   - It then calls the `shortestPalindrome` function to calculate the shortest palindrome of the input string.

-----------------------
- The primary objective of the code is to identify elements in an array that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times, where n is the size of the array.
- The `majorityElement` function employs a voting algorithm to determine potential candidates for majority elements efficiently.
- It iterates through the array, updating counts for two potential candidates (`candidate1` and `candidate2`).
- If a candidate's count becomes zero, a new candidate is chosen.
- In the end, the code counts the occurrences of the potential candidates to verify if they appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times.
